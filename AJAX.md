#AJAX

In talking about how the DOM is used to manipulate page content, we are essentially describing the function of AJAX, or spelled out: Asynchronous Javascript And XML.

AJAX is a technique for creating fast, dynamic web pages. It allows us to update parts of a web page without reloading the page. It was first made popular with Google's predictive search.

AJAX is based on internet standards, and uses a combination of:

-XMLHttpRequest object (to exchange data asynchronously with a server)
-JavaScript/DOM (to display/interact with the information)
-CSS (to style the data)
-XML/JSON (often used as the format for transferring data)
