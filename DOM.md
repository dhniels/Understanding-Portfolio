#Document Object Model (DOM)

The DOM is essentially an API for the documents being loaded into the browser. From W3C: “It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated”

The DOM manages files storing data, traditionally XML, but now being more commonly JSON.

The DOM is, in a practical sense, the developer tools that you use in the browser.

Javascript can manipulate the DOM and make the web page load new content and change the HTML that was initially loaded to make the page dynamic without refreshing. This allows you to load content from XML/JSON files obtained from your own or other peoples site.
