#JavaScript Objects

W3Schools provides a very easy and relatable explanation of objects:

>In real life, a car is an object.

>A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop. 

>For example:

>Properties:	

>car.name = Fiat

>car.model = 500

>car.weight = 850kg

>car.color = white	


>Methods:

>car.start()

>car.drive()

>car.brake() 

>car.stop()


>All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.

>All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.
